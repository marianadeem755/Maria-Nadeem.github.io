## ðŸ’¼ **Creating a Standout Portfolio**

* We are building this Portfolio website using the **mkdocs** library, which is a simple and powerful tool for creating static websites. 
* It allows us to focus on writing content in Markdown while it takes care of generating a clean and professional looking website for us.
* With mkdocs, we can easily organize our content into sections, add navigation menus and even customize the design using themes. Itâ€™s perfect for creating a portfolio because it keeps everything neat and easy to manage.
### **Key Features of MkDocs**
